# Welcome to the 42 Inception üêã

### What is **42 Inception**

This project from 42 school aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker.


### What is **Docker**

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker‚Äôs methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
